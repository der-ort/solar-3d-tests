Testing react-three-fiber with a solar system explorer.

- Most MVP parts are working.


  TODO:
  - ADD Leva for speed and size and lighting controls
  - ADD Fly controls
  - ADD sun as a realistic lighting source
  - ADD shaders for planets
  - ADD make planets glow on hover (halo effect)
  - ADD Zoom to planet bounds
  - ADD global Start/stop controls
  - ADD moons from planet object (pointers to children as they are their own celestial bodies, right)
  - BUG: WHEN HOVERING PLANETS JUMP AROUND... important to fix -> state and ref problem?
