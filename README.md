Testing react-three-fiber with a solar system explorer.

- Most MVP parts are working.


  TODO:
  - ADD Leva for speed and size and lighting controls
  - ADD Fly controls
  - ADD realistic sun
  - ADD shaders and textures for planets
  - ADD make planets glow on hover (halo effect)
  - ADD Zoom to planet bounds
  - ADD moons from planet object (pointers to children as they are their own celestial bodies, right)
